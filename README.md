### Hey, I'm Shahryar Tavakkoli ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer and a freelancer, building high performance, resilient systems.
I do almost all of my work in Elixir and PHP, Swift and have built a number of open source libraries to make it easier to build and test Application software.


I recently created a new group called [mishka-group](https://github.com/mishka-group) which creates open source projects for Elixir and Phoenix, please follow me there If you've found some value in any of the stuff I've worked on.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a powerful Elixir and Phoenix open source cms ([MishkaCms](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka-cms))
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about high-scale, distributed systems
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help to find a job and immigrate to another country
